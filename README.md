## Why We Built This
The current condition of COVID-19 has impacted a lot of small businesses due to less customers visiting a physical store. 
Small businesses in general also find it difficult to find new suppliers and handle their inventory effectively as they
are new to the business environment. 
We have provided a solution to the small business merchants where they can connect with each other and manage their business effectively.

## Project Description 
Our web application provides a portal that can connect merchants that are looking for products to buy and to sell with each other and proactively manage their inventory as well as advertise themselves through the help of offers on their prodcuts. Using VISA Payment APIs, we can facilitate secure payments on purchase and automatic inventory updation. In times of pandemic, where finding local business would be in the best interest of both parties, the Merchant Locator API provides the means of locating nearby merchants. Merchant Measurement has also been used to study the trends in the transactions that occur on the platform. Finally a rating system and a chatbot have also been implemented.

## Project Features 
* Search nearby merchants based on merchant or product within a specified radius.
* Search Visa Verified Merchants Based on Merchant Category
* Buy or Sell products to other merchants with available offers.
* Post the requirements of the products and get what you need
* Negotiate for a particular order or Pay directly using Visa Payment Methods
* Automated Inventory Management with support of chatbot and google assistant.
* Check your performance based on your merchant category and your daily transactions.
* Set Controls for merchant categories on your card payments.
* A seperate module to manage offers for prouducts in merchant's inventory
* An easy to use interface to help small businesses grow back in current conditions.
